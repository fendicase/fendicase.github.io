Thanks to in part from Russia\'s scientists work hard now, each of us the possibility of using his mind to control anything. It is understood that these scientists have created a very special, can use mind control of a four-axis aircraft.　　This four-axis aircraft and did not match the external controller, users just need to wear a matching helmet will be able to use the power of thought (or ideas) to control it. The helmet\'s main use is to read the human mind, and translated them into machine instructions, so that users will be able to through the helmet \"command\" four-axis aircraft flying high, flying as far.　　The research project is funded by Russia of Advanced Research Foundation, the Organization has supported a number of research projects in favour of national defense. As reported in the odditycentral, is located in Russia zelienuogele Neurobotics company successfully developed the four-axis aircraft aircraft design work that has been going on for many years before.

Operators need to reflect certain actions at the right time, so that the helmet can be identified. ”![Alt What remote control?

Vladimir Konyshev added: \"more importantly, control of four-axis aircraft operators to do other things at the same time. Also only achieve such results, we can discuss the possibility of steering technology for military purposes. ”　　Now, scientists have been able to test this device, through mental control four-axis aircraft, while other activities can also be controlled. Russia Advanced Research Foundation of Vitaliy Davidov said, this technique is very important, because it can control four-axis aircraft in addition, there are many other uses. He said: \"the mind has infinite possibilities, this technology is very interesting, not only for four-axis aircraft control. ”　　This technology also has great potential in the game area. In first-person shooter game, for example, when you start fighting, you can use the ideas to control the character moving or shooting, combined with virtual reality displays, obviously virtual reality game for real results.　　According to reports, the researchers plan to implement this technology in field combat. For example, a helicopter to chase a found in a hail of soldiers, and for him to provide a real-time picture of everything that happens on the battlefield. In addition, there is nothing to show that this technology will go into consumer markets. But there is no doubt that, once the technology into the consumer market, will bring the biggest impact on the market.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: Science and technology\r Design , GadgetsIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
