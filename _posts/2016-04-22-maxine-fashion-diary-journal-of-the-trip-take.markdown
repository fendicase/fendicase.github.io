This is my and vylette filming trip to Shanghai in the new heaven and Earth. 51 years ago several editors asked Emma recommend wearing a lift while you travel tips, I personally feel that the most important is comfort while you travel. So, we see that a lot of my street is flat shoes + feet pants match, travel does not need to exaggerate the cutesy items, even if there are plans to shoot, I would easily match the items on the basis of some material and color combinations on new. \"Practical + comfort\" is the dress rules, especially while traveling, some clever use of the skills to be able to match a unexpected results. Those colors look more elegant, I would choose the bright bags as embellishment. In color, silver sunglasses and Lok Fu shoes with flat end echo. In addition, choose the more lively striped knit shirts and ripped jeans of three of the most popular, you see, is not based on basic items, matched completely effortless, but also the style that most girls are able to control. In the eyes of professional the fashionistas may think that such a match is not high fashion, but bloggers think \"on the big\" match or let the stars, supermodels to interpret it. \r My fashion, I call the shots, there is no need to give up yourself for pure fashion features and style, we must insist on the most grounded and practical recommendations for the mix of people who like us.![Alt \"MAXINE fashion diary\" Journal of the trip take](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1581/26560028865_2abea85d80_b.jpg)![Alt \"MAXINE fashion diary\" Journal of the trip take](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1602/25955047504_6c17bb321a_b.jpg)![Alt \"MAXINE fashion diary\" Journal of the trip take](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1507/26493962701_5cdeb39cb2_b.jpg)![Alt \"MAXINE fashion diary\" Journal of the trip take](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1626/26534038326_6a686ed644_b.jpg)![Alt \"MAXINE fashion diary\" Journal of the trip take](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1609/25957128753_f7cb01b403_b.jpg)![Alt \"MAXINE fashion diary\" Journal of the trip take](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1518/25955073314_42125722ab_b.jpg)![Alt \"MAXINE fashion diary\" Journal of the trip take](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1501/26467724052_0159d24cd9_b.jpg)![Alt \"MAXINE fashion diary\" Journal of the trip take](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1564/26287177550_1929836560_b.jpg)![Alt \"MAXINE fashion diary\" Journal of the trip take](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1467/25955090904_1eed05bd46_b.jpg)Fashion trip take a match shooting items
