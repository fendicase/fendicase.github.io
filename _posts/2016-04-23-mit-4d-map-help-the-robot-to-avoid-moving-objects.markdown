But in order to prevent them collide with the moving object will not be so easy. On Thursday, Massachusetts Institute of technology released a new algorithm to help the robot to avoid moving objects.　　Help the robots decision making algorithm, there are two: one is \"centralized\", another is \"decentralized\". The former refers to a computer to make a decision for the robot team, which means that each robot to make their own decisions. The latter approach has advantages in terms of integrating local observation data, but this method is more complex, since each machine has to guess the other robot what to do.　　Massachusetts Institute of technology this new algorithm belongs to the latter category, the \"decentralized\", not only can avoid fixed obstacles, and avoid moving objects. In the new algorithm, each robot uses its own data, and then worked out no obstruction in the vicinity of the area.[![Alt Ted Baker iPhone 6 Plus](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/ted_baker_i6p1209_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/ted-baker-iphone-6-plus-case-tanalia-oil-blossom-p-4468.html)　　Next, the machine will calculate their obstacle-free area map share to other robot around within a relatively close range. When one machine after receiving the map, will compare its own map and calculate overlap and share to others around.　　Because each machine to only communicate with the robot around within a relatively short distance, thus greatly reduces communication bandwidth required, especially when there are many robot around. Ultimately, each robot has a map indicating all obstacles (detected by the robotics team as a whole).

But under the required conditions, new algorithms can also be used for trimming.

In a room, people come and go, and the robot\'s task is to take specific items in the room.　　Similarly, the test result is perfect. At next month\'s International Conference on Robotics and automation, MIT will be demonstrating this new algorithm.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: robot\r , The Internet Science and technology
