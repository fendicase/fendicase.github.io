The CES Conference, which launched the GCS3 really as cool as said?

But it really is different from say-it really is a huge head-mounted devices, recently a prominent Panel 7-inch. Virtual reality helmets designed to bring users, immersive environments, and the outside world, and this product is not completely closed. Is different, and one eye, respectively compared to traditional broadcast a video of the 3D, 3D Head GCS3 feels like a mini home theater.![Alt GCS3 virtual reality device really such \"Oculus killer\"?](http://designeriphone.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/7834add2.jpeg)GCS3 weighs 1.7 pounds (770 grams), is a big burden for the head, company COO James Jacobs said, there are two reasons, one is the battery itself weighs 1 lb (453 grams), and Furthermore, this is just a prototype, if the product really came out, the weight will be reduced by half.Compared with the 2010 prototype of the Oculus Rift, GCS3 like a larger version.

However, the Groove is also more than that.The cheating is on the price. GCS3 priced 595 dollars, yes you read that right, it includes a huge helmet and built-in flat panel interface.When you move your head, just like moving a flat-panel screen. Helmet of a section of the my world video sample, I can turn the head, as observed in the real world environment.But here\'s the thing, why should I use to play this game?

In such ways to play games, watch videos, or doing something else, is too unwieldy.So, the \"Oculus killer\" label GCS3, more or less exaggerated.
