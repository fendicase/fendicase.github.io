Grand Theft Auto 5 for players to create a vivid urban \"mega\", those amazing details that make people wonder, \"this is a real city.\" Since VR first came into the market, I believe almost all of the players are hoping that with these devices \"entry\" to the fascinating world. Unfortunately, the big boss of the Grand Theft Auto series VR does not seem interested.![Alt VR in the Grand Theft Auto is not because employers are not optimistic about](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7348/27226539360_9702072b50_b.jpg)　　Take-Two are the players of the Grand Theft Auto series, Rockstar\'s parent company, its CEO Strauss Zelnick accepted an interview a few days ago. VR is now one of the game\'s highlights, he can\'t avoid the question. However, Zelnick was not optimistic about the technology. \"It is too expensive right now,\" he said, \"one needs to prepare for a special room to play the 2000-dollar entertainment there is no market. ”　　\"I don\'t know what other people think, may be there is some people have such a room can make that kind of entertainment, but what about the real world? In the United States have no such requirements. \"He went on.[![Alt Victorias Secret](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/victorias_secret_i6p1103_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/victoria-s-secret-pink-iphone-6-plus-case-letters-rose-p-4393.html)　　Strauss Zelnick said the price to some extent when it comes to the point. Though Oculus Rift $ 599 and HTC Vive $ 799 and $ 2000 seems a far cry from what he said, but we have to take into account a PC running the VR game is very expensive, not to mention the HTC Vive and room requirements. \"We just want to make a $ 300 piece of entertainment, we do not have a private room. We just need a screen, a sofa, a pair of handles. \"Zelnick said,\" we don\'t have that need you standing on the ground, with two handles on the head in his hand was wearing something, and take care not to kick the table game. We don\'t have this kind of thing. ” [Victorias Secret iPhone Case](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/7117276/This-is-how-to-get-a-bum-like-a-Victorias-Secret-model.html)　　In fact, as early as two years ago, Zelnick has publicly said he was not interested in VR. He said: \"we want you to be able to play the game for a long time--we don\'t want people to faint to spit it out. But after this experience, I\'m not sure you can wear this on your head for long time. ”　　It would appear that Strauss Zelnick on VR is very firm, so we also do not need to look forward to the official of the Grand Theft Auto 5 VR support. Not even in the Grand Theft Auto 6 applications of this technology.　　But from another angle, Strauss Zelnick the VR view has some validity. Grand Theft Auto is the kind you can make love to play all day games, but VR experience more comfortable, it is difficult for you to play the game.
