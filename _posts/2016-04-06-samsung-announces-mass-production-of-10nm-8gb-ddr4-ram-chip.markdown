Last week, Samsung started shipping 18nm DRAM technology, and agreed to offer the memory chips to Apple. Starting 18 nm DRAM production is small, because Samsung last year will upgrade 60%-70% DRAM capacity to 20 nm. Reported that, in order to further improve productivity, Samsung is also installing more semiconductor equipment, is expected to increase capacity this summer.　　In the manufacturing process, chip the thinner the better, 10-nanometer chip thickness is thinner than 20 nanometers, its low energy consumption and high efficiency.[![Alt Starbucks iPhone 6 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6/starbucks_i63204_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/starbucks-coffee-cup-silicone-iphone-6-case-brown-p-4962.html)　　Samsung last year 70% has been converting DRAM capacity to 20nm, now entered the era of 18nm and lead to further expand. Global memory-chip market, followed by SK 18 nm DRAM Hynix plan next year commercialization; third-ranked Micron Technology stagnated at 20 nm standstill.　　CPU processor arrived from 20nm from 20nm to 16/15nm,DRAM memory 16/14nm,NAND Flash memory from 20nm to 18nm, however, DRAM memory back and didn\'t stop.　　Today, Samsung announced that 8Gb, DDR4 DRAM has begun mass production of 10nm technology, became the world\'s first mass-produced 10nm memory manufacturers. This is Samsung\'s first production in 2014 20nm-class 4GB DDR3 after another milestone.

Such advantages would significantly raise the next generation of consumer market of high performance PC and Server Enterprise network data transmission efficiency of the market.

Later this year, Samsung mobile tablet launched in the areas of new technology, the mobile DRAM memory particles.　　Samsung\'s memory President, Yang Xianjun said: \"10nm of Samsung DRAM allow the efficiency of IT systems for the highest level, will become a new engine of growth for the global storage industry. In the near future, we will launch the next generation of 10nm-scale high-density Mobile DRAM products to help handset manufacturers to develop more innovative products, increase the convenience of mobile users.　　Samsung said the new technology overcame significant technical challenges in the DRAM industry, including unique cell design technology or even quadruple exposure (QPT), very thin dielectric layer deposition, and more, and still using the argon fluoride Immersion Lithography has not enabled are expensive and immature EUV EUV Lithography.　　Later this year, Samsung will use new technology to produce new particles of mobile DRAM memory, peace machine based on smart phone field.　　With the advent of new technology, the expansion of production capacity, and a decline in PC demand, cell phone demand growth slowed, a substantial decline in memory prices this year, characteristically at least would drop in the second half, up to a maximum of 40%.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags:PC and hardwareIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
