Today, we take a look at, in the eyes of foreigners, written in Chinese and what are the pros and cons.[![Alt Hermes iPhone 6 plus flip case]([[2, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h060/h22/img201509291646480.jpg\', \'Foreigners in the eyes of the Chinese character: enhanced analytical skills/ability\', \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1630/24723936664_0f72a57007_z.jpg\']])](http://www.nixcase.com/hermes-iphone-6-plus-leather-case-rose-p-4858.html)　　A Chinese fan, as well as English translators Pierrick Jaouen said:　　Advantages:　　Writing Chinese to exercise people\'s analytical capacity, space allocation, enhance people\'s visual memory, non-visual memory, discipline, patience. (Written for so many years in Chinese, I really don\'t know what was in the process of learning, we benefit so much, but they say is written, we are now on the keyboard)　　Analysis: one character can be broken down into sections, upper and lower, some left, some let you guess the meaning to simple, others let you guess the pronunciation (read, not read, Chinese know, though not 100%)　　Discipline: order of Chinese characters, with different strokes, you will need to comply with. Such as a round character, the Chinese must you write inside the word, write out.　　Space allocation: when you write Chinese characters, each character the space occupied by the same, whether it is 1, or 15.　　Visual memory skills: learn when you must remember that the Chinese character shape, key parts of the character, structure and location. Remember these process, the ability to exercise your Visual memory.　　Non-visual memory: remember the pronunciation according to the stroke.　　Patience and vision: writing takes a lot of patience, especially the practice of Chinese calligraphy. Another 3,500 Chinese characters also requires patience and method.　　Simple to read Chinese characters are also helpful:　　Helping people understand new or difficult concept: thanks to Chinese characters, Chinese children can understand what on paper is democracy, what the meaning of is schizophrenia, as well as other new words. When I was studying Chinese, I don\'t know what these words mean, know I saw Ruby.　　Chinese characters so that we have a new way of looking at the world, has opened up new worlds, such as \"contradiction\" is actually \"spear + shield.\"　　Learning Chinese will help you to more easily learn Japanese because Japanese is reference arising from the Chinese language. Similarly, after learning Chinese, you are better able to learn Korean and Viet Nam language. Even if these two words have doesn\'t look like Chinese characters, but after you learn, you will find, there is the shadow of a large number of Chinese characters, you\'ll learn faster.　　Another Netizen YanGuang Wang abroad (if you don\'t know the name of the Chinese name, as he was a foreigner, but Chinese, even classical! Don\'t know classical Chinese is not a legendary Chinese test 10) [http://www.nixcase.com/images/large/i6plus/hermes_case_i6p2003_lrg.jpg](http://www.nixcase.com/images/large/i6plus/hermes_case_i6p2003_lrg.jpg) 　　Advantages:　　Same content more space to write in Chinese. (I agree that the same word, expression of Chinese line complete, English 2 lines! ）　　Disadvantages:　　1 for a foreigner, especially people who used the Roman alphabet, Chinese is hard to learn.　　2 even if you can read the content, but you may not be able to read it, because the pronunciation of the Chinese character logo.　　3 because it\'s hieroglyphics, Chinese eyes.　　In addition, I personally think that efficient use of Chinese syllables. For example, Spain the syllables of the words Restaurante 4. Family 4 syllables can be expressed in Chinese \"at 8 tomorrow morning\", \"at 8 tomorrow morning\", write the English language is \"tomorrow morning at 8 o\'clock.\"　　In order to prove Chinese characters, more space, more efficient, and the foreign friends in classical Chinese to testify (service! ）：　　The best:　　With distance. Wushu identical so you see it.　　Bad: [Hermes iPhone 6 plus flip case](http://www.nixcase.com/hermes-iphone-6-plus-leather-case-rose-p-4858.html) [Hermes iPhone 6 Plus Case](https://medium.com/@smartwatch/do-intend-to-change-the-new-tv-new-year-look-at-the-best-recommendation-d46a9aa9255#.ip432e4ud)　　1 in EE, difficult, and Rome, especially.　　2 read, not read, without the words.　　3 eye, Word.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: Internet And anecdotesIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
