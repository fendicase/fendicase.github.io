You patched the way Harry Potter online?Hands in the air, and then scroll through the pages began to miraculously ... ... About this? [VERUS iPhone 6 Case](http://www.zagcase.com)Microsoft research team launched in 2012 a Sonic gestures technology, users need only microphone or microphone can be achieved. This principle is very simple: in Internet time, the microphone high frequencies and the human ear cannot hear the sound. When sound waves reflection are waving signs, it produces offsets, and the computer is able to decode these sound waves and analysis, determine the user action.[![Alt VERUS iPhone 6 Case](http://www.zagcase.com/images/large/i6/verus_iphone6_i63108_lrg.jpg)](http://www.zagcase.com/verus-iphone-6-case-damda-slide-series-poppy-red-p-4941.html)Behind it is a physics concept of wavelength and frequency: the Doppler effect, its application everywhere in life. For example, when the oncoming train, you will feel the tone rising; and when it left you when, tone lower.Currently, the team has been able to identify a range of actions including scroll, click, grab and rotate, and accuracy rate of up to 90%. However, this design is only as an auxiliary of the Microsoft Kinect sensor device. After all, gesture recognition is mainly divided into two-and three-dimensional level, most of which is dependent on the camera hand gestures observed, in addition to Kinect and SoftKinetic\'s flying time, and Leap angular Motion Imaging.![Alt Harry Potter-Internet access is what kind of experience?

As long as there is a microphone, browse the Google browser will be able to air more than gestures, users like to graduate from Hogwarts feel impaction da.Products being not really promotion, however, due to its requirement of hardware equipment is very simple (just basic equipment such as microphones), it becomes very wide range of applications.If you want to know \"Harry Potter online is a kind of experience,\" poke here:)via gizmodo & danielrapp.github![Alt Harry Potter-Internet access is what kind of experience?
